# MY PORTFOLIO PROJECT

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
this project was an attempt to show my ability in applying my knowledge of css and HTML and excluding java script to form a working and functional website that showed elements of responsiveness. This was highlighted in the implementation of flex box and using media queries to make said functional website to do things like. I also used a wire framing process of mocking up my design and creating the website as close as possible to said design. The project also utilizes some subtle animation to smooth out some of the transitions.

## SOME OF THE ISSUES 
I ran into issues with flex box with but felt I overcame them quite well by going back and debugging my code to find the issues. Then taking logical steps to save what code I could but still get a desired out come. I ran into an incredibly irritating issue of not knowing what exactly mobile size was and also when the viewport would go below 600-700px it I would have a large gap on the right side. I did fix this issue by finding a good trouble shoot method that I will definitely be using in the future that would have saved me hours. I found the issue by creating borders around my elements to see what was breaking out and realized it was the cards. the issue was to stop the cards from forming a column to early due to their flex styles I had to set a min width however did not realise that would become such an issue when scaling down. I set media queries to play with this value and through trial and error manged to eliminate the gap on the right side on the google chromes mobile S,M,L viewport. This glaring issue has made me understand why web developers tend to build outward now starting with mobile design first from a practical standpoint. In future I will likely build from mobile first to avoid these kind of issues again but now know how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

## SIDE NOTES & DISCLAIMER
To demonstrate the functionality of the website I have given the cards links that function however not to my work as I don't have enough work to be put on show at this point. However in the future I would simply just swap the links in the Index.html but as of right now it shows that the process works.
