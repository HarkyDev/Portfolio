# MY PORTFOLIO PROJECT

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
this project was an attempt to show my ability in applying my knowledge of css and HTML and excluding java script to form a working and functional website that showed elements of responsiveness. This was highlighted in the implementation of flex box and using media queries to make said functional website to do things like. I also used a wire framing process of mocking up my design and creating the website as close as possible to said design. The project also utilizes some subtle animation to smooth out some of the transitions.

## SOME OF THE ISSUES 
I ran into issues with flex box with but felt I overcame them quite well by going back and debugging my code to find the issues. Then taking logical steps to save what code I could but still get a desired out come.
